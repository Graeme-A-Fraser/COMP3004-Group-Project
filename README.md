## How-to

1. Open a console and navigate to where your AndroidStudioProjects folder is. In my case it's C:\Users\Eric\AndroidStudioProjects\

2. Do a git clone of the project so the folder structure ends up like C:\Users\Eric\AndroidStudioProjects\COMP3004-Group-Project-Boondoggle
	```
	git pull https://github.com/Graeme-A-Fraser/COMP3004-Group-Project-Boondoggle.git
	```

3. Now open android studio and press file -> open

4. You should be able to open COMP3004-Group-Project-Boondoggle directly

5. Now test it out by pressing run

## What's done?

* Rough prototype
* Game loop, frame limiting and skipping
* Model, View, Controller Heirarchy
* Different views
* Grid
* Building towers
* Creeps with hp bars

## Todo

* Refactor/Cleanup code - a little messy at the moment but that's what prototypes are supposed to be
* Need to discuss design decisions (how many towers, creeps, what the building section should look like)
* Adding images/sprites
* Properly implement gold system, live system
* Create recruiting 'view'
* Possibly a more detailed build 'view'... maybe have the grid so when you click on it if there is no tower taking you to a page to select a brand new tower, and if ones already there to upgrade a tower
* Tons more
