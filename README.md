## How-to

1. Open a console and navigate to where your AndroidStudioProjects folder is. In my case it's C:\Users\Eric\AndroidStudioProjects\

2. Do a git clone of the project so the folder structure ends up like C:\Users\Eric\AndroidStudioProjects\COMP3004-Group-Project-Boondoggle
	```
	git pull https://github.com/Graeme-A-Fraser/COMP3004-Group-Project-Boondoggle.git
	```

3. Now open android studio and press file -> open

4. You should be able to open COMP3004-Group-Project-Boondoggle directly

5. Now test it out by pressing run

## My vision

_I think for simplicity's sake this is the most simple way to break it down_

1. Splash Screen
2. Battleground View
	* Can navigate to build or recruit
	* Once wave recruited, can start wave sending your creeps at them and their creeps at you
