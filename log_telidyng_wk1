What I worked on:
  - Learning how to use Android Studio
  - Researched how to implement the zoom-in and zoom-out camera option for android phones
  - Created very simple .app to demonstrate this feature for an image
  
Issues:
  - Unfamiliar with version control (when/how to commit, create new files etc.)
  - Unable to find a way to make image fill the screen 
  (researched and found methods like including the same image file in different pixels, or changing xml)
  
Working on next:
  - Research how to make background fit for different android screens
  - How to merge code with other member's work
